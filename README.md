## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Solid](https://solidjs.com/) - JS library
- [Css Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) - For styles
- [Vite](vitejs.dev) - Build tool

### What I learned

This was my first time using solidjs. I learned how to use css modules and how to manage states in solidjs. I also learned how to use css variables to change the theme of the website.

I consider Solid to be a very interesting library, since it is very similar to React (simpler in fact), but it has some interesting features like "signals" and "stores".


### Continued development

I want to continue learning solidjs and css modules. I think the concept of "signals" in solidjs is very interesting and I want to learn more about it.
